# Clientele Project

## The project files

The controllers folder is supposed to contain some of the backend equivalent code for some of the views. The core folder contains the backend code and everything concerning the database, and the core functions, classes and methods that help the server function. Views contains the frontend code, for the most part, with partials being the repeatable stuff for the html pages, such as the header and the footer. config.php is very contains the configuration of the database, such as the database name, the table name, the username and password, etc...

## The project

As requested, this is a clientele that supports viewing the details of each client, as well as editing them and deleting them. There's also a paging system to prevent overload of the system by selecting all entries of the database. The bare minimum CSS was also done, to make everything readable.
